"""Tracing operations.

This file collects common tracing operations, i.e., traces that each control the
execution of programs in a specific manner. For example, 'condition' traces a
program and fixes the value of random variables; and 'tape' traces the program
and records the executed random variables onto an ordered dictionary.

def condition(**model_kwargs):
  """Context manager for setting the values of random variables.

  Args:
    **model_kwargs: dict of str to Tensor. Keys are the names of random variable
      in the model. Values are Tensors to set their corresponding value to.

  Yields:
    None.

  #### Examples

  `condition` is typically used for binding observations to random variables
  in the model, or equivalently binding posterior samples to random variables
  in the model. This lets one compute likelihoods or prior densities.

  ```python
  import edward2 as ed

  def probabilistic_matrix_factorization():
    users = ed.Normal(0., 1., sample_shape=[5000, 128], name="users")
    items = ed.Normal(0., 1., sample_shape=[7500, 128], name="items")
    ratings = ed.Normal(loc=tf.matmul(users, items, transpose_b=True),
                        scale=0.1,

def tape():
  """Context manager for recording traceable executions onto a tape.

  Similar to `tf.GradientTape`, operations are recorded if they are executed
  within this context manager. In addition, the operation must be registered
  (decorated) as `ed.traceable`.

  Yields:
    tape: OrderedDict where operations are recorded in sequence. Keys are
      the `name` keyword argument to the operation (typically, a random
      variable's `name`) and values are the corresponding output of the
      operation. If the operation has no name, it is not recorded.
